## Experimental

This is just an app to show how you could send events to Simple Analytics with an Expo app.

We will convert this demo app to a package you can just install with `npm install expo-simple-analytics`

This file is probably what you want to see: [./react-native-simple-analytics.js](./react-native-simple-analytics.js)
